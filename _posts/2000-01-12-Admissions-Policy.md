Chattahoochee Hills Charter School will not discriminate against any student based on race, ethnicity, national origin, gender, or disability or for any other basis that would be unlawful for a public school.  CHCS shall be open to any child who is eligible under the laws of the State of Georgia for admission to a public school, and CHCS shall ensure compliance with all applicable anti-discrimination laws governing public schools, including Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, and the Americans with Disabilities Act.  New students will be admitted each year without regard to prior measures of achievement or aptitude, athletic ability, disability, handicapped condition, ethnicity, race, creed, gender, sexual orientation, national origin, religion, or ancestry.

### Publicity and Outreach

Each year, the school holds information sessions to inform families and community members about the school and the admissions process.  These information sessions are held at the school and perhaps at other community-based locations.  The sessions are publicized widely, through means such as flyers, mailings, and informational sessions at daycares, community organizations, and local businesses.  Families are encouraged to visit the school to see classes in action and meet currently enrolled students.

### Enrollment Process

Families interested in enrolling a child at CHCS are required to submit a completed entry form.  The entry forms are made available at the school’s information sessions.  After submitting the entry form, parents are required to attend a Mandatory Parent Orientation where school systems, procedures, and rules are reviewed in detail.  The final steps in the enrollment process include attending the student orientation in August and the first day of school.  There are no fees associated with the filing of an application, nor are there any tuition charges for attending the school.

### Special Requirements for Kindergarten

Only students who turn 5 years old by September 1st of the matriculation year are eligible for kindergarten.

### Admission Lottery

In the event that CHCS receives more applications than allotted spaces, the school holds a lottery.  This random and publicly held lottery is audited by a disinterested independent organization.  All applicants are notified of the time and the place of the lottery and are invited to attend.  If needed because of enrollment demands, this lottery will be held before April 1st each year.

Lottery preference is given to children with siblings at the school, as well as children of board members and employees of CHCS.

### Student Recruitment Activities

CHCS may undertake the measures below, among others, to recruit student applicants:

* Sending letters to residents of the Fulton County School District and surrounding private and charter schools;

* Posting flyers and notices in local newspapers, supermarkets, churches, community centers, and apartment complexes;

* Conducting open houses at public and private elementary daycares, after-school programs, and youth centers;

* Visiting local organizations in surrounding neighborhoods; and/or

* Canvassing neighborhoods to further reach interested families.

CHCS aims to attract a student population that is similar in demographics to that of the Fulton County School District.  Through extensive outreach, CHCS will attract students who reflect the demographics of FCS, including students with disabilities and students who have Limited English Proficiency.  CHCS is committed to attracting and retaining such students by offering a high-quality educational program, hiring and training highly-qualified teachers, and communicating regularly with families.

### Enrollment and Eligibility

All students who are accepted for enrollment must complete all of the school’s enrollment forms by the date required on the forms to secure provisional enrollment.  CHCS reserves the right not to enroll any student whose forms are not returned by the designated date.  All new students must take the school’s baseline standardized tests.  Parents/guardians and students are required to attend information sessions and orientations, sign the Entry Form and Family-School Contract, and agree to fulfill their obligations to CHCS including adherence to the Code of Conduct.

In addition to the requirements described above, a child is eligible for kindergarten only if s/he turns 5 years old by September 1st of the matriculation year.  A child may not be eligible for admission if the parent/guardian and student fail to complete all required forms truthfully.

Students are considered re-enrolled for the following school year once parents complete the re-enrollment document each spring.

### Vacancies

Barring an unexpectedly high attrition rate, CHCS does not plan to accept students after the second grade.  To fill any vacancies, however, separate waiting lists are maintained for each grade level.  The random lottery used for student admission also serves to place students in preferential order on these waiting lists.  CHCS reserves the right to fill a vacancy when unexpected attrition occurs.  If the school chooses to fill a vacancy, the school contacts the parent or guardian of the student next on the appropriate waiting list.  Reasonable attempts are made to contact the family of the first student on the waiting list to determine whether the student remains interested in enrolling at the school before proceeding to the next name on the list.  If attempts to contact the student’s parents/guardians are unsuccessful, the school may remove that student from the waiting list.  Documentation of attempts made to contact the parents/guardians of any student removed from the waiting list are maintained by the school.

### Withdrawal from the School

CHCS is a school of choice.  As such, circumstances may arise in which a parent or guardian wishes to transfer their child to a different school.  When parents withdraw their child from the school they should schedule a meeting with the Data Clerk to fill out the Withdrawal Form.  students who miss 105 consecutive hours of school without notifying the school are subject to being un-enrolled.  A student who attends another school is subject to being un-enrolled from CHCS.  The school ensures the timely transfer of any necessary school records to the student’s new school.
