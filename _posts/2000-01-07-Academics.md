## Academic Standards

As an innovative, nature and arts based elementary school, CHCS has the highest academic standards for all students.  It is expected that students will take challenging classes, complete high-quality work promptly both at school and at home, study for and perform well on exams, and receive excellent support from the teaching staff through in-class interventions and small group tutoring.  The highest effort from students, teachers, and parents/guardians is necessary to reach this goal.

## General Academic Calendar

During the 2015-2016 school year, school will be in session from August 10, 2015 to May 26th, 2016.  The year will be divided into three semesters as outlined below:

  Semester 1: August 10 – December 18
  Semester 2: January 6 - May 26


## Promotion Policy

We believe that students should only be promoted when they have demonstrated mastery of academic standards.  CHCS is founded upon the understanding that promoting students to the next grade because of their age, not their readiness to do the work, is not beneficial to students.  Thus, one of the most critical and distinctive aspects of CHCS’s academic program is its promotion policy.  To build a culture of learning and achievement, and to ensure students demonstrate readiness for the next grade level, we will use a strict and simple promotion policy.

In order for your child to be promoted to the next grade, he/she must meet certain criteria.  It is our continued goal CHCS to keep you informed as parents to provide a premier, innovative, hands-on elementary experience for your child.  Below are specific areas of concerns that could affect the promotion of your child  Data from each criterion will be reviewed by the Principal, Leadership team and teachers in order to make decisions around promotion and retention.

Standards-Based Student Report Card

Each standard on each subject on the student’s individual report card is assigned a numeric grade to indicate how well the student performed.  students receive a 4, 3, 2, or a 1 for each area.  A "4" indicates Exceeding grade level expectations, a “3” indicates meeting grade level expectations, a “2” indicates progressing, but needs additional work, “1” indicates failing to meet grade level expectations.  students must receive no less than a 2 passing rate on standards in reading and math in order to be promoted.

Important Considerations

*Attendance and Punctuality:* The student’s attendance patterns (excused and unexcused absences, tardies, and early dismissal) and its effect on student progress will be taken into account (See Consequences for Absences and Consequences for Tardies/Early Dismissals in Chapter 2).  Specifically, students that miss twelve or more days of school throughout the year, whether excused or unexcused, are at-risk for retention.

*Homework Completion and Quality:* students are expected to complete all assigned homework with quality, accompanied with a parent signature.  This includes the nightly reading log and the behavior log.  Although promotion and retention will not be based solely on completing homework, homework quality and completion helps to ensure that students will perform well on in-class assignments and assessments.

Retention Based on Truancy

In addition to CHCS’s policy for students that miss twelve or more school days, the law prohibits promotion of a student to the next grade level if the student has been truant for more than ten percent of the required attendance days of the current school year and has failed two or more of the required curriculum subject areas in the current grade, unless the Principal, Director of Curriculum/ Instruction and the teachers of the failed subject areas agree otherwise.

Students with Disabilities

Promotion and retention of previously identified disabled students may be subject to the factors and policy above, but shall also consider the contents of the student’s individualized educational plan (IEP).

A Final Word on the Promotion Policy

Retention and/or placement decisions will be made only after the school has notified and conferred with parents throughout the year (progress reports, report cards and parent conferences, etc.) as to the student’s progress or lack thereof.  Promotion of a student from one grade to the next shall be based solely on that individual student having met applicable promotion criteria as described above.  However, the final decision to promote a student shall rest solely with the Principal, with appropriate input from the leadership team, the student’s teachers, and the professional staff.

## Homework

CHCS will assign homework to students regularly. The homework will be meaningful and will serve an important purpose of extending the learning that goes on in the classroom.  Homework has developmental benefits as well as academic benefits.  It helps develop students’ responsibility, time management, and independent problem solving skills.  The development of these skills is essential to a student’s success CHCS and to excelling in life.  Each night, students are expected to complete all homework in a thorough manner paying attention to detail and quality.  Homework completion is mandatory and every homework assignment must include a parent signature to be considered complete.  Students with incomplete or missing homework assignments are required to miss their enrichment class that day to make up homework or to start working on that night’s assignments.

Parents/guardians must be aware and supportive of their child’s efforts with homework. Parents are expected to actively check and review their child’s homework each night and to let teachers know if their child is struggling.  Parents may assist students with their homework, but should never do it for them.  Parents should review their child’s homework for quality and completeness.

## Cheating & Other Academic Infractions

Students found to have cheated, plagiarized, or committed any other act of academic dishonesty will receive a Community Violation for the first occurrence.  The second infraction will result in a suspension.  A third infraction may result in an expulsion.

## Assessment

In addition to internal progress monitoring assessments, CHCS will use regular external assessments to support its educational program.  These assessments will include, but are not limited to:

* Georgia Milestones (GM) tests in April/May in third grade through fifth.

* NWEA will be given at the beginning, middle, and end of each year for grades (K-5)

* Other placement tests which may be necessary at the discretion of the school.

Participation in these assessments is required.  students are expected to give their best effort on every assessment.

## Grades

Each standard on each subject on the student’s individual report card is assigned a numeric grade to indicate how well the student performed. Students receive a 4, 3, 2, or a 1 for each area.  These numbers can be interpreted as follows:

* 4 – Exceeds Expectations

* 3 – Meets Expectations

* 2 – Progressing but Needs Additional Work

* 1 – Failing

Students who receive a grade below 70% in any class are considered to have failed the class.  If a student ends the year with a failing grade in any class, they may be required to attend summer school or repeat the grade.

## Report Cards

Students receive a report card for each semester, which includes a summary of their academic work.  Report Cards are provided to parents/guardians at the parent conference night.  The second semester report card will be mailed the week following the last day of school.  Parent/Guardian attendance at the Parent Conference nights is required to receive the report card or interim report.

Progress reports will be issued to all students once each trimester.  students bring progress reports home, and they must be reviewed with parents/guardians, signed to indicate they have been discussed, and returned to school.

## Academic Classes

All students CHCS take the same academic classes.  Except under extraordinary circumstances, every student will enter reading, writing, math, science, and social studies during each year.  General intentions for each discipline are described below:

### Reading

Literacy is the key academic skill on which all future skill and knowledge acquisition is based.  Research has repeatedly demonstrated that success or failure in forming a foundation of basic literacy in the early grades is a strong indicator of later academic success.  We provide our students with at least 90 minutes of reading instruction each day.

### Writing

Written expression is closely linked with success in college-preparatory middle and high schools and higher education.  As such, we aspire to teach our students to see themselves as writers with a unique voice and the powerful ability to express, communicate, question, persuade, synthesize, and teach others through their writing.  Beginning in kindergarten, we provide a writing curriculum that helps students to develop and hone their writing through the use of mentor texts, daily modeling of writing strategies by teachers, explicit handwriting and grammar lessons, one-to-one conferring, and publishing pieces at the conclusion of each unit.

### Mathematics

As Bob Moses, the renowned educator and civil rights activist, has noted, algebra has become a gate-keeper to college admissions for many.  CHCS teachers develop a rigorous, content-rich math program that is designed to carry all students through a minimum of one year of high school algebra by the time they complete eighth grade.

### Science and Social Studies

At CHCS, our yearlong academic planning ensures that both Science and Social Studies are organized into cohesive units that build upon one another as the year progresses and are integrated daily.
