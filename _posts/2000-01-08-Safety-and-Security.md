## Closed Campus

CHCS is a closed campus.  CHCS’s school hours are between 8:10 a.m. and 3:15 p.m. students who are excused at dismissal time may leave campus if they do not have other obligations. When on campus, students must always be in class and under the supervision of an adult.

Students who need to leave campus early must be picked up by a parent/guardian or authorized individual. The parent must sign the student out of the school’s attendance log before the student will be released.

## Visitor Policy

The Board welcomes and encourages visits to school programs by parents, other adults, and interested educators.  But in order for the educational program to continue undisturbed when visitors are present and to prevent the intrusion of disruptive persons, it is necessary to invoke visitor controls.  All visitors, including parents and volunteers, must report to the school office upon entering the school building and sign the guest register.  This procedure has been adopted for the safety of our students and staff.  Children from other schools may not visit during the school day.  Exceptions may be made at the Principal or his/her designee’s discretion for families who are considering enrollment.

The Principal, Dean of Student Culture, Director of Operations, or Director of Curriculum and Instruction or his/her designee has the authority to prohibit the entry of any person, including but not limited to parents, other adults and/ or educators, to a program of the school or to expel any person when there is reason to believe the presence of such person would be detrimental to the good order of the program.  If such an individual refuses to leave the school grounds or creates a disturbance, the Principal or his/her designee is authorized to request from the local law enforcement agency whatever assistance is required to remove the individual.

The Principal or his/her designee may implement such administrative guidelines as are necessary for the protection of students and staff from disruption to the educational program or the efficient conduct of their assigned tasks.  As such, the following visitor policy has been put in place CHCS in order to maximize our student’s learning time and minimize distraction in our classrooms.  We ask that you do the following:

* Do not schedule any school visits during the first three weeks of the school year.

* Call to schedule your visit 24 hours in advance.

* Plan to stay for 30 minutes to 2 hours (visits lasting less than 30 minutes or longer than 2 hours can be a disruption to the daily schedule).

* Upon arriving, sign in with the Main Office.

* Refrain from interacting with students so that they are able to pay attention to their teachers at all times.

* Turn off your cell phone prior to entering the classroom.

* Sit behind students so that you are not between them and their teacher.

* If you would like to speak with a teacher following your visit, please contact them by phone or call the school to set up a follow-up meeting.  Teachers will be unable to meet or talk with you during their teaching time.

If a visitor is coming to school to drop something off for a student or to leave a message, we still require that the visitor come first to the Main Office.  For the sake of student safety, we cannot have anyone unannounced in the building.

## Student Emergencies

In case of an emergency, parents or guardians should contact the Main Office either by phone or in person.  Under no circumstances should parents or guardians contact students in their classrooms, including after-school activities, or attempt to withdraw students from the building without notifying and receiving permission from staff members in the Main Office.

## Accident or Medical Emergency

If a medical emergency occurs to a student at school, first aid will be administered and the parent(s)/guardian(s) of that student will be contacted immediately.  If parent(s)/guardian(s) cannot be reached, a person listed on the student’s health form (or emergency contact card) or the family physician will be contacted. If the situation warrants, the school will call Emergency Medical Services (911).  If there is a serious accident at school, parent(s)/guardian(s) of the affected students will be notified immediately.  In the event that the parent(s)/guardian(s) cannot be reached, the family physician or persons indicated on health forms will be contacted. First Aid will be administered as needed.

## Medication Policy

To protect your child’s safety, school administrators will adhere to the following medication policy.  Beginning in August 1996, it is required that both parent’s and physician’s signatures are on file before any prescription and non-prescription medication is administered.  This includes all medications including such over-the-counter products as Tylenol, Advil, Dimetapp, etc.

Although this may cause some inconvenience, we feel that this policy is best for the continued protection of your child, and must be followed.  **If we do not have your written permission and the written permission of your physician, the medication will not be given.**  Permission forms can be obtained by contacting the Clinic Manager.

In order for your child to receive any medication at school, please conform to the following:

* A written request must be obtained from the doctor and the parent/guardian.  This request must include the name of the medication, dosage, time it is given during school hours, and duration.

* The medication must be in its original container and have a fixed label which indicates the student’s name, name of medication, dosage, method of administration and time of administration.

* When the empty prescription bottle is returned to you, please send the refill to school promptly.

* The medication and the signed permission forms must be brought to the school by the parent or guardian.

* Wherever possible, please include a photo of your child with the permission form.

* New permission forms must be re-submitted each school year, and are necessary for any changes in medication orders.

* If your child is taken off medication or will no longer receive it at school, please put your request in a dated, written note as soon as possible.  If the medication is not picked up from the school office within 10 days, it will be properly disposed.



Please contact the Clinic Manager or his/her designee if you have any questions.  Thank you for your cooperation.

## Fire Alarms

In case of an emergency – if a student or staff member sees fire or smells smoke—he or she should close the door and pull the nearest fire alarm.  Upon hearing the alarm, school staff will assemble students in their rooms and proceed out of the building according to the fire evacuation plan posted in each room.  students should follow the direction of staff members who will lead students outside the building to the designated locations, where school staff will line up students by class and take attendance.

During the first week of school and frequently throughout the school year, students and staff will participate in fire drills to ensure that the entire school community is familiar with the appropriate response in the event of an emergency.  In case of a more serious emergency, should it be necessary to evacuate our school before, during, or after the school day—and it appears that we will be unable to return to the school for an extended period of time—school staff and students will evacuate from each of the school’s buildings.  A copy of each evacuation plan is available from the Director of Operations upon a family’s written request.
