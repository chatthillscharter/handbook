CHCS supports each scholar’s emotional growth by celebrating their achievements.  Most of these celebrations take the form of school-wide events which celebrate student academic achievement and character growth.  These include monthly Unity Circle celebrations and various family celebrations throughout the year including the Holiday Potluck, Kindergarten Celebration, and Title I nights such as Family Fun Night.  In addition, each class celebrates students’ birthdays by singing happy birthday and other rituals in a uniform way that is the same for and fair to all students.  Teachers seek to make students feel truly special on their "special" day.

To maintain the structure and consistency of the school day as well as to preserve sacred learning time, CHCS only allows for the celebration of birthdays during the lunch block.  Families **must** communicate with the classroom teacher at least **two weeks prior to the celebration**.  Our focus must be on instruction during the instructional day and parties or treats will shift the focus of the school day away from instruction.

Families wishing to involve classmates in the celebration of their scholar’s birthday or other holidays can do so by inviting them to a party that occurs outside of school hours. The school can support such families by distributing a flyer to families in that student’s class. To avoid hurt feelings and distractions from learning, however, the school can only do this if **every** student in the class is invited. Families wishing to have such an invitation distributed should send it to school. Invitations must be general (as in not addressed to specific students) and must be issued to all students in the class. In order to minimize competition and distractions from learning, students must be in full uniform on their birthdays and other holidays.
