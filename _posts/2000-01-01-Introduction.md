## Purpose

The 2015-2016 CHCS Student and Family Handbook is a guide to the most important policies and procedures of the school.  Many of the most critical aspects of the handbook will be reviewed with parents during our open house, and with students during their orientation.  However, it will be important for parents to read the handbook in its entirety and discuss it with their scholar(s).  We encourage you to ask questions throughout the year if any sections of the handbook are unclear.  Every policy and procedure was crafted with the best interest of our students in mind.

## Organization of the Handbook

The handbook is organized into eight chapters with a number of topics in each chapter.  It is our intention to provide the most important topics in these chapters written in clear, concise language.  At the end of the handbook, there are five appendices that provide additional information and a Statement of Understanding that needs to be signed and turned into the school.

## Development of the Handbook

The CHCS Student and Family Handbook is meant to be a useful guide to the school’s operations.  From time to time, policies, rules, and regulations may be changed.  The Principal or his/her designee or the Board will provide notifications of changes and/or notice will be posted in the common area of the School’s facilities.

The Student and Family Handbook is based on a comprehensive school policy manual developed by the law firm Eastman & Smith.  All Policies upon which this handbook is based shall be considered public records and are open for inspection by appointment in the office of the Principal or his/her designee during regular office hours.
