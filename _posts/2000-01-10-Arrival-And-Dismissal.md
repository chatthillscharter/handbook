Specific information regarding arrival and dismissal will be distributed to parents at the start of the school year.  Details for the arrival and dismissal process may vary by grade level and/or class.  The bulleted points below serve as general reminders for families.

**Arrival**

* The school officially opens to students at 7:00 a.m. for EMAP and 8:00 a.m. for those not attending EMAP.  All students and families should enter the school through the buildingâ€™s main entrance.

* students arriving before 8:00 a.m. must be supervised by a family member or other adult and cannot be "dropped off" or left alone in front of the building before 8:00 a.m.

* students arriving late (at 8:35 a.m.) must be escorted by their family to the CHCS front desk.

* Unless students and families have made an appointment with individual teachers or other staff beforehand, students and families must remain outside the building until 8:00 a.m. unless participating in morning extended day.

**Dismissal**

* The school day officially ends at 3:15 p.m.

* Under no circumstances should parents remove students from the campus prior to 3:15 p.m. This is done to protect the safety and well-being of all of our students.

* No student will be allowed to leave the school without an adult escort.

* Families must submit a release form (provided in August) listing the names and information for any individuals, besides parent / guardians, who regularly are authorized to pick up their children.
