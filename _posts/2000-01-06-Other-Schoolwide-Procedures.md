## General Discipline Procedures

The purpose of disciplinary consequences is to ensure that both individual students and the school community maintain complete focus on learning and growth.  Inappropriate student behavior not only impacts the individual, but also exacts a cost on the larger school community.  students must understand that they are a part of a larger whole and are accountable to their peers for adhering to the values and expectations of the community.  Prompt resolution of problems and student/family solutions to inappropriate behavior is expected.  

Disciplinary action, depending upon the nature of the action and/or referral, may include but is not limited to: re-teaching, checks, community violations, parent notification, a written assignment, lunch or enrichment detention, community service, suspension, or expulsion.

All decisions regarding disciplinary action will be made by the Principal, and/or administrative team.  CHCS will make every effort to notify parents/guardians promptly of any disciplinary action and will do so in writing whenever possible.

## Student Searches

The School recognizes that the privacy of students may not be violated by unreasonable search and seizure and directs that no student be searched without reason or in an unreasonable manner.

The School acknowledges the need for in-school storage of student possessions and shall provide storage places, including desks and lockers, for that purpose.  Where locks are provided for such places, students may lock them against incursion by other students, but in no such places shall students have such an expectation of privacy as to prevent examination by a school official.  The Board may require the Principal or his/her designee to conduct a regular search at least annually of all such storage places.

students have no expectation of privacy with respect to the use of the internet, intranet or e-mail.  Routine maintenance and monitoring of the school network system may lead to the discovery that a student has or is violating school policy or the law.  Violations of school policy, the student code of conduct or the law may result in severe penalties, up to and including expulsion.

School authorities are charged with the responsibility of safeguarding the safety and well-being of the students in their care.  In the discharge of that responsibility, school authorities may search the person or property, including vehicles, of a student, with or without the student's consent, whenever they reasonably suspect that the search is required to discover evidence of a violation of law or of School rules.  Specifically:

Search and Seizure of Property:

1. School lockers, desks, and property are on loan to the students and remain the property of the school.  They may be inspected and reclaimed at any time.

2. students must not keep prohibited items, including drugs, drug paraphernalia, firearms, explosives, and property belonging to others within their lockers, backpacks or desks.

3. students must open their lockers at the request of school officials.

4. When on school grounds, students and their personal property may be searched if a school official has grounds to believe the search may turn up evidence that the student has violated or is violating the law or school rules.  

5. A student shall have the opportunity to be present during the search of his or her locker, desk, or other property unless the student is absent from school or the safety or welfare of the school or an individual necessitates a search during the student's absence.

The search of a student's person or intimate personal belongings shall be conducted by the Principal or his/her designee.  This person should be of the student's gender and conduct the search in the presence of another staff member of the same gender.  However, no strip searches may be conducted by school personnel.

This authorization to search shall also apply to all situations in which the student is under the jurisdiction of the school.

Administrators are authorized to arrange for the use of a breath-test instrument for the purpose of determining if a student has consumed an alcoholic beverage.  It is not necessary for the test to determine blood-alcohol level, since the School has established a zero tolerance for alcohol use.

The School also authorizes the use of canines, trained in detecting the presence of drugs, when the Principal or his/her designee has reasonable suspicion that illegal drugs may be present in the school.  This means of detection shall be used only to determine the presence of drugs in locker areas and other places on school property where such substances could be concealed.  Canine detection must be conducted in collaboration with law enforcement authorities or with organizations certified in canine detection and is not to be used to search individual students unless a warrant has been obtained prior to the search.

The Principal or his/her designee shall be responsible for the prompt recording in writing of each student search, including the reasons for the search; information received that established the need for the search and the name of informant, if any; the persons present when the search was conducted; any substances or objects found; and the disposition made of them.  The Principal or his/her designee shall be responsible for the custody, control, and disposition of any illegal or dangerous substance or object taken from a student.

*U.S. Const. Amend. IV, XIV*

## Suspension and Expulsion

The Principal may suspend a student for up to ten (10) school days.  The Principal, with board approval, may expel a student for up to eighty (80) school days and in some instances one (1) year.

In the event that, in the opinion of the Principal or his/ her designee, a student's presence at the school creates a health risk, presents a danger to other persons or property or seriously disrupts the functions of the school, the student may be removed from the premises without formal suspension or expulsion procedures, with notice and procedures to follow the removal in accordance with Fulton County Schools’ expulsion policy.

A student shall be expelled for one (1) year for bringing a firearm to the school or onto school Property (any property owned, used or leased by the school for school, school extracurricular or school-related events).

A student may also be expelled for a period not to exceed one (1) year for:

1. bringing a firearm to an interscholastic competition, an extracurricular event, or any other school program or activity that is located at a school or on school property;

2. bringing a knife to the school, onto school property or to an interscholastic competition, an extracurricular event or any other program or activity sponsored by the school or which the school is a participant;

3. possessing a firearm or knife at school, on school property, or at an interscholastic competition, an extracurricular event, or any other school program or activity which firearm or knife was initially brought onto school property by another person;

4. committing an act that is a criminal offense when committed by an adult that results in serious physical harm to persons or serious physical harm to property;

5. making a bomb threat to a school building or to any premises at which a school activity is occurring at the time of the threat.

A firearm is defined as any weapon, including a starter gun, which will or is designed to or may readily be converted to expel a projectile by the action of an explosive, the frame or receiver of any such weapon, any firearm muffler or silencer, or any destructive device.  A destructive device, includes but is not limited to, any explosive, incendiary, or poison gas, bomb, grenade, rocket having a propellant charge of more than four (4) ounces, missile having an explosive or incendiary charge of more than one quarter ounce, mine, or other similar device.  

A knife is defined as any cutting instrument consisting of at least one sharp blade.

The specific circumstances under which the Principal may modify a one (1) year expulsion could include:

1. a recommendation from the group of persons knowledgeable of the student's educational needs in accordance with The Individual with Disabilities Education Act;

2. the student was unaware that s/he was possessing a firearm or knife;

3. the student did not understand that the item s/he possessed was considered a firearm or knife;

4. the student brought the item to School as part of an educational activity and did not realize it would be considered a firearm or knife; and

5. the student may be eligible for participation in an alternative program.

A student may be expelled for up to eighty (80) days for serious misconduct or rules violations, or for other just cause.

During the period of suspension, removal, or expulsion the student may not attend or participate in any School functions without permission from the Principal.  The student may enter school facilities only when given permission by the Principal or if accompanied by a parent or guardian who accepts responsibility for the student's actions and/or behavior at the facility.

While serving an out-of-school suspension or expulsion, the Board does not authorize students to receive instructional services from the school.  

The Board also authorizes the Principal to suspend a student from any or all co-curricular or extra-curricular activities for misconduct or rules violations.  The length of suspension shall be determined by the Principal commensurate with the seriousness of the student's misconduct or rules violations in accordance with the Code of Conduct.  Participation in extra-curricular activities is a privilege and not a right.  Accordingly, students prohibited from participating in all or part of any extra-curricular activity, are not entitled to notice, hearing or appeal rights.

The Board authorizes the Principal the option to require a student to perform community service in conjunction with, or in place of a suspension or expulsion, except when an expulsion is imposed for bringing a firearm to school or onto property.  

The Principal shall be responsible for implementing this policy and ensuring compliance with applicable laws.

A copy of this Policy is to be posted in common areas of the School and made available to students and parents upon request.

## Habitually Disruptive students

Any student who is suspended for disruptive behavior for the first time during any one school year while in school or on school grounds, at a school-sanctioned activity or event, or on school-sponsored transportation will receive a remedial discipline plan.  The plan will be reviewed and modified after the second suspension and the student will be placed on disciplinary probation.  In all such cases, the student and his/her parent/guardian will be notified in writing.  If the student receives a third such suspension, the student will be declared habitually disruptive, and CHCS may recommend expulsion.  **See the discipline charts in Appendix E for detail on the definition of and related consequences for "Disruptive Behavior" and “Other Overt Disruptive Behavior”.**

## Corporal Punishment and Student Restraint

All teachers, administrators, non-licensed School employees and contracted employees are prohibited from inflicting or causing to be inflicted corporal punishment as a means of discipline upon a pupil attending the school.  However, they may, within the scope of their employment, use and apply such amount of force and restraint as is reasonable and necessary to quell a disturbance threatening physical injury to others, to obtain possession of weapons or other dangerous objects upon the person or within the control of the pupil, for the purpose of self-defense or for the protection of persons or property.

## Discipline for students with Special Needs

Disruptive behavior, as defined by school policy, by a student with disabilities will be managed in accordance with the student’s individual education plan (IEP) and state and federal law.  A student with disabilities will be subject to recommendation for expulsion as a habitually disruptive student only if the appropriate special education team has determined that the disruptive behavior is not a manifestation of the student’s disability.

## Complaints about Student Discipline

The school administration and the Board work in conjunction to hear and resolve any complaints.  In the event of a complaint regarding student discipline, both the school administration and the Board encourage the complainant to address the problem directly with the staff member involved.  If the complainant is dissatisfied with the resolution proposed by the staff member involved, or if such resolution is not practical under the circumstances, he or she should schedule a meeting with the Principal.  

If an individual believes that the school has violated any applicable laws or regulations, or if he or she is unsatisfied with the results of the above process, he or she may file a formal, written complaint with the Board.  After receiving the complaint, the Board will respond in writing to the individual within 30 days.  To file a complaint with the board, use the board’s website at [http://governance.chatthillscharter.org](http://governance.chatthillscharter.org).

## GROWING Character, Communication Binders, and Behavior Tracking
