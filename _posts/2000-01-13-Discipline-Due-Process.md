## Suspension Due Process

The following procedure does not apply to in-school suspensions.  The Principal may suspend a student if the following procedure is met:

1. Prior to the imposition of the suspension, a written Notice of Intent to suspend will be given to the student, which contains the following:

    1. The reasons for the intended suspension; and

    2. If the suspension is based on one of the serious criminal offenses for which permanent exclusion is allowed, and if the student is age 16 or older, the notice must also indicate the possibility that the Principal may seek permanent exclusion.

2. The student must be allowed an informal hearing before the Principal or his/her designee to challenge the reasons for the intended suspension or otherwise explain his actions.  The student is not entitled to call witnesses at this informal hearing.

3. Within one school day after the suspension is imposed, the Principal or his/her designee shall provide written notification to the parent, guardian, or custodian of the student and the board Chairman of the suspension.  The notice must contain the following:

    1. The reasons for the suspension;

    2. Notification of the right to appeal to the Board of Directors or its designee.  The intent to appeal must be in writing and received by the Board of Directors within 14 days after receiving the notice.

    3. The right to representation at all appeals;

    4. The right to a hearing before the Board or its designee; and

    5. The right to request that the hearing be held in executive session.

If the suspension is based on one of the serious criminal offenses for which permanent exclusion is allowed, and the student is age 16 or older, the notice must also indicate the possibility that the Principal may seek permanent exclusion.

Suspensions imposed during the last ten days of the school year may be carried over into the following school year.  However, only the Principal may impose a carryover suspension.

## Expulsion Due Process

Only the Principal may expel a student.  The following procedure is required:

1. Prior to the imposition of the expulsion, the Principal must provide not only the student, but also the parent, guardian, or custodian written notice of his intention to expel.  The notice must include the following:

    1. The reasons for the intended expulsion; and

    2. The time and place for a hearing, which must be not less than three nor more than five school days after giving the notice, unless the period is extended by the Principal at the request of the student, his parent, custodian, guardian or representative.  The parent, guardian, or custodian must be sent written notice of any extension, and the subsequent notice should contain the same information required in the original notice.

    3. If the student is age 16 or older and the expulsion is for one of the serious criminal offenses for which permanent exclusion is allowed, the notice must also indicate the possibility that the Principal may seek permanent exclusion.

2. A hearing must be scheduled not less than three or more than five school days after giving the notice, for the student and his parent, guardian, custodian or representative to appear in person before the Principal to challenge the reasons for the expulsion or otherwise explain his/her actions.

3. Within one school day after the expulsion is imposed, the Principal shall provide written notification to the parent, guardian, or custodian of the student and the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the expulsion.  The notice must include the following:

    1. The reasons for the expulsion;

    2. Notification of the right to appeal to the Board of Directors or its designee.  The intent to appeal must be in writing and received by the Board of Directors within 14 days after receiving the notice.

    3. The right to representation at all appeals;

    4. The right to an appeal hearing before the Board or its designee;

    5. The right to request that the hearing be held in executive session;

    6. If the expulsion is based on one of the serious criminal offenses for which permanent exclusion is allowed, and the student is age 16 or older, the notice must also indicate the possibility that the Principal may seek permanent exclusion;

    7. When the Principal expels a student for more than twenty days or for any period of time extending into the next trimester or school year, the School shall provide, along with this notice, the student and his parent, guardian or custodian with information about services or programs offered by public and private agencies that work toward improving those aspects of the student’s attitudes and behaviors that contributed to the incident giving rise to the expulsion.  The information must include names, addresses, and phone numbers or the appropriate public and private agencies.

During the period of expulsion, the School may, but is not required to, continue educational services in an alternative setting.

The Principal is required to follow through on expel-able offenses even if the student in question withdraws from the School prior to the hearing or the Principal’s decision.

The Principal may apply any remaining part or all of the period of expulsion into the following year.
