## Philosophy

CHCS students will abide by a Code of Conduct based on the philosophy that classroom respect and order are essential for academic progress, that students benefit from the explicit teaching of acceptable behavior, and that having immediate and clear consequences for seemingly minor infractions guarantees that major infractions will not take place.  Parents, a teacher, and the Principal will sign the Family & School Contract, which demonstrates knowledge of the Code of Conduct.  The purpose of this Code is to bring absolute clarity to the expectations and consequences of student behavior so that misunderstanding is never the reason for student misbehavior.

## Intention

CHCS is committed to providing an engaging, standards-based education in order to ensure success in life.  Respectful behavior without disruptions is necessary to achieve this goal.  The following beliefs inform our Code of Conduct:

* **Safety**.  The Code of Conduct is designed first and foremost to ensure that CHCS is safe for every student at all times.

* **Responsibility**.  One of the CHCS character traits is responsibility.  Responsible behavior is a hallmark of effective character development and facilitates strong community.

* **Self-discipline**.  By learning to behave professionally, students learn skills useful beyond the walls of CHCS.  students who behave well in school, speak well in public, and are helpful to others will develop strong self-advocacy skills that will serve them well throughout their lives.

* **Making a big deal out of "little" problems**.  The leaders of CHCS believe that there are no “little” problems, but that every seemingly small problem can quickly contribute to more serious problems.  By making a big deal out of “little” problems, the school can make sure that big problems happen infrequently.

* **Clear consequences**.  Many disciplinary problems can be avoided by having clear, well-articulated consequences.  The students of CHCS will know exactly what behavior is expected and what consequences will result if the expectations are not met.  The school will always promptly communicate with parents about any disciplinary consequence.

* **Uninterrupted learning**.  The purpose of this Code of Conduct is to remove distractions from the classroom so that students can commit 100 percent of their attention to academic learning.

## Family & School Contract

The Family & School Contract is the guiding commitment between CHCS students, staff, and parents/guardians.  A parent/guardian, teacher, and Principal will sign the Family & School Contract by the first week of school.  This contract outlines general and specific expectations for students, teachers, and parents/guardians, and is signed in the spirit of mutual accountability.  Our work together is a three-way partnership, and the highest expectations must govern all of our actions to ensure the highest-quality education for every child.

## Progressive Discipline

All students are expected to conform to the Student Code of Conduct at School, on the School premises, and on transportation to and from filed lessons, if paid for or provided by the School and are subject to the School’s disciplinary process when they fail to do so.

When students violate the Code of Conduct there are associated consequences that are outlined for different levels of offenses.  Consequences will be determined based on the level of offense and the number of occurrences for similar offenses during the school year.  The four levels of offenses are described below:

First Level: Checks and Color Changes

1. Teacher explains or reviews class and School rules.

2. Teacher applies appropriate in school consequences (i.e. checks and/or color changes).

Second Level: Community Violation

1. Teacher applies appropriate consequences, including loss of privileges or a Community Violation.

2. Teacher personally communicates the problem(s) with the student’s parent(s).

3. Teacher may send a written report home and a copy to the office.

Third Level: Suspension

If actions taken at Levels 1-2 have not corrected the inappropriate behavior, or, if the student engaged in serious act(s) of misconduct, the Principal may suspend the student from School, not to exceed ten school days.  As a part of the suspension, the student will be required to catch up on all academic work and write an apology to the classroom community.

Fourth Level: Expulsion

If actions taken at Levels 1-3 have not corrected the inappropriate behavior, or, if the student engaged in serious act(s) of misconduct, the Principal may expel the student from School, not to exceed 80 days, unless one year is specifically authorized, or, unless the student is permanently excluded.

Progressive discipline levels may be skipped for serious acts of misconduct at the discretion of the Principal.  The charts in Appendix E define and provide guidance to parents and students regarding how the progressive discipline policy may be utilized for serious offenses, not specifically listed in the eighteen rules on page 17.

## School Rules and Consequences

*Rule 1: Disrespect*

CHCS is committed to maintaining a respectful learning environment to effectively delivery the academic program.  Disrespectful behavior to other students or to school staff will never be tolerated.  Any student who demonstrates disrespect toward another student or staff member, in the judgment of any member of the staff, will receive a reminder, and in the case of serious disrespect, will receive a color change or a suspension.

*Rule 2: Dress Code*

The purpose of the CHCS dress code is to create a professional, safe, and respectful community where students can place their sole focus on learning.  The dress code is in effect from the start of the school day until the end of the school day, and includes after-school activities and field trips.  students are required to wear the CHCS uniform Monday-Friday, unless otherwise noted.

students must arrive at school in the CHCS uniform every day.  See Chapter 4 for an in-depth overview of the School’s dress code policy.

Any student who arrives at school out of uniform will be prevented from participating in class until he or she is in uniform.  The school staff retains the sole right to interpret and enforce the school’s dress code.

*Rules 3-4: Attendance and Tardy/Early Dismissal Policy*

Refer to Chapter 2: Consequences for Absences and Consequences for Tardies /Early Dismissal

*Rules 5-10: School-Wide Discipline and Classroom Policies*

Any student who violates Rules 5-10 will receive a reminder or color change.  If the violation is serious or occurs multiple times, the student will receive a Community Violation, or, at the discretion of the school leadership, an out-of-school suspension or in-school suspensions.

Records of student behavior will be recorded in each scholar’s Communication Binder.  The behavior log will be sent home with students every night and must be signed by a parent.

*Rules 11-14: Suspension*

**Any student who violates Rules 11-14 will receive an immediate suspension.**

A student may be suspended from one day to up ten days.  A formal notification will be given to the parent(s)/guardian(s).  As a part of the suspension, the student will be required to catch up on all academic work in accordance with the Family and School Contract and will be asked to read an apology to the classroom community.

*Rule 15: Gang Affiliation*

The Board believes gangs or gang activity create an atmosphere that seriously disrupts the educational process.

students are prohibited from engaging in gang activities while at school, on school property, or at school-sponsored events.

As used herein the term "gang" means any ongoing organization, association, or group of three or more persons, whether formal or informal, having as one of its primary activities the commission of one or more criminal acts, which has an identifiable name or identifying sign or symbol, and whose members individually or collectively engage in or have engaged in a pattern of criminal gang activity.

The term "gang activity" shall mean any conduct engaged in by a student 1) on behalf of any gang; 2) to perpetuate the existence of any gang; 3) to effect the common purpose and design of any gang; or 4) to represent a gang affiliation, loyalty or membership in any way while on School grounds or while attending a School function.  These activities include recruiting students for membership in any gang and threatening or intimidating other students or employees to commit acts or omissions against his/her will in furtherance of the common purpose and design of any gang.

A violation of this policy is grounds for suspension or expulsion from school.  **See the discipline charts in Appendix E for detail on the definition of and related consequences for "Gang Activity."**

*Rule 16: Violence Policy*

The primary purpose of the Code of Conduct is to ensure that the CHCS community is safe for all students.  As a result, violent behavior towards students, staff, or visitors will never be tolerated and will be treated with the most severe consequences.  Any student who commits an act of physical violence at school, on school-sponsored transportation, at a school-related event, or plans such violent activity during the school day, will receive an immediate suspension and may be grounds for expulsion from school.  **See the discipline charts in Appendix E for detail on the definition of and related consequences for "Assault", “Criminal Act”, “Hazing”, “Physical Contact”, and “Reckless Endangerment.”**** **

*Rule 17: Drugs, Alcohol, and Tobacco Policy*

Student use, possession, distribution, or sale of alcohol, tobacco, or illicit drugs is prohibited on school grounds, at any school-sanctioned activities, when students are being transported in school-sponsored vehicles, or at any time or in any place where the School conducts business.  A student violation of this policy will lead to a suspension, reporting to authorities, and/or recommendation for expulsion, as required by law, or at the discretion of the School.

If a student receives a suspension for a first violation of this policy, the student may be required to enroll in a rehabilitation/counseling program at the sole cost of the family.  The family, when appropriate, will be required to report back with an assessment, diagnosis, and treatment plan a condition for admittance into the school.  A second violation of this policy will be reported to authorities and lead to an expulsion hearing.

**See the discipline charts in Appendix E for detail on the definition of and related consequences for "Illegal or Dangerous Substances", “Sale, Use, Possession, or Distribution of Alcohol, Drugs, or other Chemical Controlled Substances” and “Sale, Use, Possession, or Distribution of Tobacco Product.”**

*Rule 18: Weapons*

Guns, knives, explosives, or weapons of any type are not permitted in the school, on the campus, anywhere on the premises, on school-sponsored transportation, or at any school-sponsored or school-related event.
