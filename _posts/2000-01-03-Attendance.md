## General Policy for Absences

Students enrolled in the school must attend school regularly in accordance with the laws of the State.  The educational program offered by the school is predicated upon the presence and punctuality of the student and requires continuity of instruction and classroom participation.  A parent must contact the school in accordance with the procedure set forth in the section below whenever a student is absent.

Attendance shall be required of all students enrolled at the school during the days and hours that the school is in session.  **Attendance need not always be within the school facilities, but a student will be considered to be in attendance if present at any place where school is in session by authority of the Board.**

## Reporting Absences

The primary responsibility for a students's attendance at School rests with his/her parent(s) or guardian(s).  Parent(s)/guardian(s) must notify the school by 9:00 a.m. on the day a student is absent unless previous notification has been given in accordance with school procedure for excused absences.  When parents do not call the school, the person in charge of front desk operations will notify a scholar's parents, custodial parent, guardian, legal custodian, or other person responsible for him/her when the scholar is absent from school.  The parent or other responsible person shall be notified by telephone or written notice shall be mailed on the same day that the scholar is absent.  Parents or other responsible persons shall provide the School with their current home and/or work telephone numbers and home addresses, as well as emergency telephone numbers.

The procedure for absences is as follows:

1. A parent must call the school to inform the school that his/her child or children will be absent from school.  This phone call should take place within the first hour that school is in session. _Informing your teacher is not enough. You must inform the front desk of the school._

2. If a parent fails to call the school as prescribed in Part 1, school personnel will call the parent to inform him/her of the child's absence.

3. In those cases where telephone communication could not be made, school personnel will initiate a written communication to the home of the legal guardian the day of the scholar's absence.

## Excused and Unexcused Absences

All absences, whether "excused" or “unexcused”, are still considered absences.  Any day your scholar does not attend school is considered an absence.  The school will consider an absence excused for the following five reasons with documentation:

1. Personal physical illness such as to prevent attendance at school.  Absences for illness longer than 2 days must be verified in writing by a doctor.  

2. Death in the family.

3. Observance of religious holidays.

4. Court subpoena.

5. An emergency or set of circumstances which in the judgment of the school constitutes a good and sufficient cause for absence.

Emergency circumstances will be defined by the Principal and will be used to excuse absences on an extremely limited basis.  Absences due to weather, transportation issues, parent illness, and family vacation will count as unexcused absences.  Upon return to school, the student must provide to the school a written statement from a parent of the cause for absence, or the absence will be considered unexcused.  The Principal or his/her designee reserves the right to verify such statements and to investigate the cause of each individual absence.

## Absences due to Documented Medical Condition

Any scholar who, due to a medically-documented physical or mental impairment, is absent for an extended period will not be disciplined. Such students may be entitled to receive an education tailored to their individual needs or abilities as provided for under federal and/or state law.

## Appointments during School Hours

Students should never miss school for non-emergency appointments.  Families are responsible for scheduling medical appointments outside of school time.  The best times are often after the school days come to an end, or on days when school is not in session.  In the rare case when a student has a medical appointment during school, he or she should not be absent for the entire school day.

## Suspensions

Suspensions are considered absences.  If students are absent from school due to suspension, these days will be treated the same as absences.

## Late Arrival and Early Dismissal Related to Absences

Students are expected to arrive on time and to stay at school until the very end of the day.  Late arrivals and early pick-ups are disruptive to the learning environment.  students that arrive after or leave before 11:45 will be counted absent. If on an early release day a scholar arrives or leaves before 10:45 a.m. they will be counted absent.

## Consequences for Absences

Included in our attendance policy are consequences for absences, both positive and negative.  They are outlined below:

1. No Absences in a Trimester: The child and family are congratulated and recognized for exceptional attendance and commitment to their education.  

2. Four Absences in a Trimester: If a scholar is absent four times in a Trimester, it is considered a serious issue.  At this point, the parent/guardian will be called to the school to meet with the leadership team.  At the meeting, the problem will be discussed and an attendance plan will be developed.  

3. Eight Absences in a Year: If a scholar is absent eight times in a year, it is considered a serious issue.  At this point, the parent/guardian will be called to the school to meet with the leadership team.  At the meeting, the problem will be discussed and an attendance plan will be developed.  

4. Twelve Absences in a Year: If a scholar is absent twelve times in a year, it is considered a serious issue.  At this point, the student is at risk of not being promoted to the next grade.  The parent/guardian will be called to the school to meet with the Principal.  The Principal reserves the right to retain any student who misses more than twelve days of school.  

## General Policy for Tardiness and Early Dismissal

Getting to school on time is a key to your child’s success – at school and in life.  CHCS, the learning begins from the moment students walk in the door.  students who are late miss essential reading instruction, disrupt the learning of other children, and risk falling behind on our ambitious curriculum.  Our doors open at 8:00 a.m. each morning.  students must arrive between 8:00 a.m. and 8:15 a.m. in order to eat breakfast.  students who are not in their classrooms at 8:15 a.m. are considered tardy.  

In addition to tardies in the morning, CHCS also has a policy in place to address students that are picked up before the end of the school day.  CHCS’s school day ends at 3:15 p.m. Monday through Friday.  students that are picked up after the halfway point in the day but before the end of the day will receive an Early Dismissal, and this will be counted on the attendance report.

No excuses will be accepted for tardies or Early Dismissals.  There is no designation for "excused" or “unexcused” tardies or Early Dismissals.  Tardies and Early Dismissals due to traffic, weather, transportation issues, and appointments will not excuse the attendance violation.

## Consequences for Tardies and Early Dismissal

The following is an outline of consequences for tardiness and Early Dismissal:

* No Tardies in a Trimester: The child and family are congratulated and recognized for being "on

time" and for their true commitment to education.

* Four Tardies and/or Early Dismissals in a Trimester: If a student is late or dismissed early four times in a Trimester, it is considered a serious issue.  At this point, the parent/guardian will be called by the Dean of students.  The problem will be discussed and a plan will be developed to prevent future attendance issues.  

* Eight Tardies and/or Early Dismissals in a Year: If a student is late or dismissed early eight times in a year, it is considered a serious issue. At this point, the parent/guardian will be called to the school to meet with the Dean of students.  The problem will be discussed and a plan will be developed to prevent future attendance issues.  

## Truancy

A scholar is habitually truant if the student is absent without a legitimate excuse for five (5) or more consecutive School days, for seven (7) or more School days in one (1) month, or twelve (12) or more School days in one (1) School year.

A scholar is chronically truant if the student is absent without a legitimate excuse for seven (7) or more consecutive School days, for ten (10) or more School days in one (1) month, or fifteen (15) or more School days in one (1) year.

Legitimate excuses for the absence of a student otherwise habitually or chronically truant include but are not limited to:

1. the scholar was enrolled in another school;

2. the scholar’s absence was excused in accordance with applicable law or policy; or,

3. the scholar has received an age and schooling certificate.

If the scholar is habitually truant the Board authorizes the Principal or his/her designee to inform the student and his/her parents of the truancy record and the Board’s intent to notify the Fulton County Department of Children and Family Services of the student’s excessive truancy.  

The CHCS Leadership Team or designee may act as the school’s attendance officer or delegate that duty as permitted by law.  The School’s attendance officer shall investigate possible school attendance violations, and is authorized under Georgia law, to serve warrants, to enter places where children of compulsory school age are employed, and to take such other actions as may be necessary to enforce the compulsory education laws.

The Principal or his/her designee is also authorized to establish a parent education program for parents of students who are habitually truant.  Any parent assigned to the program who does not complete the program is to be reported to law enforcement authorities for neglect of child’s education, a fourth class misdemeanor if found guilty.

## Withdrawal

A student who fails to participate in one hundred five consecutive hours of learning opportunities will be automatically withdrawn, unless the student’s absence is excused.  Otherwise, a parent may withdraw a student voluntarily by signing a Voluntary Withdrawal form with the Principal or his/her designee.
