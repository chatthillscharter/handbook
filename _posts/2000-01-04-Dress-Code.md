## Rationale

The purpose of the CHCS dress code is to create a professional, safe, and respectful community where students can place their sole focus on learning.  The dress code is in effect from the start of the school day until the end of the school day.  students are required to wear the CHCS uniform Monday-Friday, unless otherwise noted.

## The Dress Code Defined

Grades K-4 are required to wear a CHCS logo embroidered *classic navy* shirt, and khaki-colored, navy blue, black, or brown pants or shorts daily.

Grades 5 and 6 are required to wear a CHCS logo embroidered *evergreen *shirt, and khaki-colored, navy blue, black, or brown pants or shorts daily.

**Logo embroidered shirt choices***. *These items must be purchased from Lands' End.

* Short or long sleeve t-shirt

* Short or long sleeve polo

* Sweater vest

* Sweater

* Fleece vest

* Fleece pullover

* Sweatshirt

* Polo-style dress (serves as both shirt and pant selection)

**Khaki pant choices** (does not require an embroidered logo)

* Pant

* Cargo pant

* Shorts

* Cargo shorts

* Skirt

* Skort

* Jumper

**Shoes**

* Rubber sole (color of your choice)

* Rain boots highly recommended as we will be outside working/learning (color and style of your choice).

**Outerwear**

* Raincoats highly recommended as we will be outside working/learning (color and style of your choice).

**Any scholar who arrives at school out of uniform will receive a dress code violation, an immediate phone call home and will be prevented from participating in class until he or she is in uniform.**

students must present a neat, professional appearance in order to be considered in uniform.  students’  shoelaces must be tied.

Under **NO** circumstances are students allowed to:

* Wear denim pants, skinny pants, or sweat pants (permitted on special occasions)

* Wear underclothes that can be seen (undershirts must be plain white t-shirts)

* Wear facial make-up of any kind

* Wear facial jewelry of any kind

* Wear earrings bigger than a quarter (boys are not allowed to wear earrings)

* Wear open toe sandals or flips flops

* Wear fake tattoos or display real tattoos

* "Sag" their pants

* Carry cell phones or other electronic devices on their person during the school day unless given permission by staff

Other dress code considerations include:

* Jewelry: For health, safety and in order to minimize distractions, only conservative jewelry is permitted.  Some necklaces of any material, bracelets, rings, earrings, nose rings, piercing and anklets may be prohibited, if deemed a health and safety risk or a risk of distraction.

* Tattoos (Fake or Real): Are considered distracting to the educational environment and process and are unacceptable and must not be visible.

* Hair: The style is a parenting decision but the inclusion of items into the hair must meet the following restrictions; the items may not be removed for any length of time during the day.  The item must be very secure.  If the hair includes any items or symbols that can be interpreted as advocating anything, the item must be removed (i.e. designs in the hair including but not limited to lines, shapes, and letters).  students may not groom themselves at school.  Hairbrushes, combs and other items used outside of the restroom or that make a trip to the restroom excessively long will be confiscated.  All students must wear their natural hair color.  When adding weave or other pieces to the hair the color must match.  These rules are deemed necessary for both males and females for the purpose of health, safety, and to minimize distractions.

* Key Chains: The keychain should be under the shirt, in the pocket completely, or put in a purse.

* Makeup: No makeup of any kind is permitted including, but not limited to, lotion, chap-stick, and glitter.

* Underclothes: Any underclothing that can be seen including, but not limited to, panties, boxers, briefs, thongs, brassieres, slips, sports bras, colorful t-shirts or t-shirts with graphics, sleeveless undershirts, socks, stockings, hosiery, and under shirts is not permitted. All t-shirts should be solid white and stay under the clothing of the child at all times.

* Swimsuits: All swimsuits must be one piece, cover the student fully, should not be transparent when wet or dry, and should not have openings that are revealing.  All swimsuits must be pre-approved by an administrator.

* Other: All other items must be authorized in writing by the Principal.

* During enrollment parents must sign a contract stating that they understand that no child may ever be out of uniform without written permission from the school for any reason.  There is no valid excuse for students to come to school without being fully compliant with the dress code.

The school staff retains the sole right to interpret and enforce the school’s dress code.
