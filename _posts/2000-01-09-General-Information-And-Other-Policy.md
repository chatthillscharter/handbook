## Non-Discrimination Statement

It is the policy of CHCS  to recruit, hire, train, educate, promote, and administer all personnel and instructional actions without regard to race, religion, sex, sexual preference, age, national origin, disability, need for special education services, marital status, or use of public assistance.  We will not tolerate any discrimination, and any such conduct is prohibited.  The school also prohibits any form of discipline or retaliation for reporting incidents.

## Anti-Harassment, Intimidation, and Bullying

The following policy must appear in any student handbook, and in any publications that set forth the comprehensive rules, procedures and standards for the School and students.  Information regarding this policy must be incorporated into employee training materials.

The School prohibits acts of harassment, intimidation, or bullying (including cyber-bullying) of any student on school property or at school-sponsored events (any event conducted on or off School property, including School buses and other School related vehicles, that is sponsored, recognized or authorized by the Board).  A safe and civil environment in the School is necessary for students to learn and achieve high academic standards.  Harassment, intimidation and bullying, like other disruptive or violent behaviors, are conduct that disrupts both a student’s ability to learn and the School’s ability to educate its students in a safe environment.  Since students learn by example, school administrators, faculty, staff and volunteers should be commended for demonstrating appropriate behavior, treating others with civility and respect, and refusing to tolerate bullying.

"Harassment, intimidation, or bullying" means either of the following:  1)  any intentional, written, verbal, graphic, or physical act that a student or group of students has exhibited toward another particular student more than once and the behavior both causes mental or physical harm to the other student; and is sufficiently severe, persistent or pervasive that it creates an intimidating, threatening or abusive educational environment for the other student; or 2)  violence within a dating relationship.  The definition of “harassment, intimidation or bullying” also includes the above described acts which are electronically generated, stored or transmitted.

The School reserves the right to discipline students’ off campus behavior which substantially disrupts the School’s educational process or mission, or threatens the safety or well-being of a Student or Staff member.  Factors which may be considered in determining whether the behavior warrants discipline include, but are not limited to, the following:  (1) whether the behavior created material and substantial disruption to the educational process or the School’s mission due to the stress on the individual(s) victimized or the time invested by Staff in dealing with the behavior or its consequences; (2) whether a nexus to on-campus activities exists; (3) whether the behavior creates a substantial interference with a Student’s or Staff member’s security or right to educate and receive education; (4) whether the behavior invades the privacy of others; or (5) whether any threat is deemed to be a true threat by the administration or Board, using factors and guidelines set out by the courts or by common sense, reasonable person standards.

Some acts of harassment, intimidation, bullying and cyber-bullying may be isolated incidents requiring that the school respond appropriately to the individuals committing the acts.  Other acts may be so serious or part of a larger pattern of harassment, intimidation, bullying or cyber-bullying that they require a response either in the classroom, School building, or by law enforcement officials.  Consequences and appropriate remedial actions for students who commit an act of harassment, intimidation, bullying or cyber-bullying range from positive behavioral interventions up to and including suspension or expulsion.  Due process procedures for suspension and expulsion will be followed, as provided for under the Fulton County School Board.  The disciplinary procedures and code of conduct of the School shall be followed and shall not infringe on any student’s First Amendment rights under the United States Constitution.

All school personnel, volunteers and students are required to report prohibited incidents of which they are aware to the Principal or his/her designee.  All other persons may report prohibited incidents of which they are aware to the Principal or his/her designee.   Anonymous communications, if necessary, may be made by telephone, electronic mail, or in writing. The Principal or his/her designee is then responsible for determining whether an alleged incident constitutes a violation of this policy.  In so doing, the Principal or his/her designee shall conduct a prompt and thorough investigation of the reported incident, and prepare a report documenting the prohibited incident that is reported.  Once an investigation is completed, if the reported incident has been substantiated, the parent of any student involved in the prohibited incident shall be notified. To the extent permitted by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (20 U.S.C. 1232g), Parents have access to any written reports pertaining to the prohibited incident, and, if the School has a website, the School shall post this summary of reported incidents on the School website.  Semiannually, the Principal will provide the Board President with a written summary of all reported incidents.    All School personnel, volunteers and students shall be individually immune from liability in a civil action for damages arising from reporting an incident in accordance with this policy.

The School prohibits reprisal or retaliation against any victim or person who reports an act of harassment, intimidation or bullying.  The consequence and appropriate remedial action for a person who engages in reprisal or retaliation shall be determined by the Principal or his/her designee after consideration of the nature and circumstances of the act, in accordance with school policies and procedures.  The school shall implement the following strategy for protecting victims:  supervise and discipline offending students fairly and consistently; provide adult supervision during recess, lunch time, bathroom breaks and in the hallways during times of transition; maintain contact with parents and guardians of all involved parties; provide counseling for the victim if assessed that it is needed; inform school personnel of the incident and instruct them to monitor the victim and the offending party for the indications of harassing, intimidating and bullying behavior.  Personnel are to intervene when prohibited behaviors are witnessed; check with the victim daily to insure that there has been no incidents of harassment/intimidation/bullying or retaliation from the offender or other parties.

Harassment, intimidation and bullying behavior can take many forms and can vary dramatically in seriousness and impact on the targeted individual and other students.  Accordingly, there is no one prescribed response to verified acts of harassment, intimidation and bullying.  While conduct that rises to the level of "harassment, intimidation or bullying" will warrant disciplinary action whether and to what extent to impose disciplinary action (*i.e.*, detention, in- and out-of-school suspension, or expulsion) is a matter left in the professional discretion of the Principal.  The following procedure sets forth possible interventions for the Principal to enforce the prohibition against harassment, intimidation or bullying.  Anonymous complaints that are not otherwise verified, however, shall not be the basis for disciplinary action.

1. Non-disciplinary Interventions: When verified acts of harassment, intimidation or bullying are identified early and/or when such verified acts do not reasonably require a disciplinary response, students may be counseled as to the definition of harassment, intimidation or bullying, its prohibition and their duty to avoid any conduct that could be considered harassing, intimidating or bullying.  If a complaint arises out of conflict between students or groups of students, peer mediation may be considered.  Special care, however, is warranted in referring such cases to peer mediation.  A power imbalance may make the process intimidating for the victim and therefore inappropriate.  The victim’s communication and assertiveness skills may be low and could be further eroded by fear resulting from past intimidation and fear of future intimidation.  In such cases, the victim should be given additional support.  Peer mediation may be deemed inappropriate to address the concern at the discretion of the School administration.

2. Disciplinary Interventions: When acts of harassment, intimidation and bullying are verified and a disciplinary response is warranted, students are subject to the full range of disciplinary consequences.  In and out-of-school suspension may be imposed only after informing the accused perpetrator of the reasons for the proposed suspension and giving him/her an opportunity to explain the situation.  Expulsion may be imposed only after a hearing before the Board of Directors, a committee of the board or an impartial hearing officer designated by the Board of Directors in accordance with Board policy.  This consequence shall be reserved for serious incidents of harassment, intimidation or bullying and/or situations where past interventions have not been successful in eliminating prohibited behaviors.

Nothing in this policy prohibits a victim from seeking redress under any provision of Georgia law that may apply.

The School may form a prevention task force and/ or programs to educate students about this policy, such as holding an assembly on harassment, intimidation and bullying for Parents and students, to raise the level of awareness and help prevent the prohibited conduct.  The School may also provide training, workshops, or courses on this policy to Staff and volunteers who have direct contract with students.

## Internet Acceptable Use Policy

**The use of technology and computer resources at the School is a revocable privilege.  Failure to abide by this policy may render you ineligible to use the School’s computer facilities and may bring additional disciplinary action.**

All users are expected to use the technology available at the School in a manner appropriate to the School’s academic and moral goals.  Technology includes, but is not limited to, cellular telephones, beepers, pagers, radios, CD/MP3/DVD players, video recorders, video games, personal data devices, computers, other hardware, electronic devices, software, Internet, e-mail and all other similar networks and devices.  Users are expected to be responsible and use Technology to which they have access appropriately.  Obscene, pornographic, threatening, or other inappropriate use of Technology, including, but not limited to, e-mail, instant messaging, web pages, and the use of hardware and/or software which disrupts or interferes with the safety and welfare of the School community, is prohibited, even if such uses take place after or off School property (i.e., home, business, private property, etc.).

**Failure to adhere to this policy and the guidelines below will result in disciplinary action as outlined in the discipline charts in Appendix E.  See these charts for details on the definition of and related consequences for "Electronic Access", “Intimidation, Menacing, Bullying, Cyber bullying”, “Misuse of Electronic Online Hardware or Software”, “Offensive Material”, “School Property”, and “Technology Misuse”.**

Unacceptable uses of Technology/Internet include but are not limited to:

1. Violating the conditions of federal and Georgia law dealing with students and employees’ rights to privacy.  Trespassing in others' folders, work, or files; copying other people’s work or attempting to intrude onto other people’s files; using other users' e-mail addresses and passwords.

2. Using profanity, obscenity or other language which may be offensive to another user; sending messages with derogatory or inflammatory remarks about an individual’s race, sex, age, disability, religion, national origin or physical attributes via the Internet or Technology; bullying, insulting, intimidating, or attacking others; transmitting any material in violation of federal or state law.

3. Accessing profanity, obscenity, abusive, pornographic, and/ or impolite language or materials, accessing materials in violation of the Student Code of Conduct.  A good rule to follow is to never view, send or access materials that you would not want your instructors and parents to see.  Should a student encounter any inappropriate materials by accident, he/she should report it to their instructors immediately.

4. Violating copyright laws by illegally downloading or installing music, any commercial software, shareware, or freeware.  You are required to strictly comply with all licensing agreements relating to any software.  All copyright laws must be respected.

5. Plagiarizing works through the Internet or other Technology.  Plagiarism is taking ideas of others and presenting them as if they were original to the user.

6. Damaging Technology devices, computers, computer systems or computer networks (for example, by the creation, introduction or spreading of computer viruses, physically abusing hardware, altering source codes or software settings, etc.).

7. Using the Technology or the Internet for commercial purposes or activities, which is defined as offering or providing goods or services or purchasing goods of services for personal use, and includes, but is not limited to, the following:

    1. any activity that requires an exchange of money and/or credit card numbers;

    2. any activity that requires entry into an area of service for which the School will be charged a fee;

    3. any purchase or sale of any kind; and

    4. any use for product advertisement or political lobbying.

8. Neither the Internet nor any other Technology may be used for any purpose which is illegal or against the School’s policies or contrary to the School’s mission or best interests.

All users are expected to be responsible, courteous and thoughtful when using Technology and the Internet.  Common sense should prevail.  The use of the School computer network system should be in support of education and research, consistent with the educational mission or objectives of the School and in accordance with federal law, Georgia law and the Student Code of Conduct.

students and Staff have no expectation of privacy with respect to the use of Technology, the Internet, intranet or e-mail.  Maintenance and monitoring of the School network system may lead to the discovery that a user has or is violating School policy or the law.  Violations of School policy, the Student Code of Conduct or the law may result in severe penalties, up to and including expulsion.

The School makes no warranties of any kind, either express or implied, that the functions or the services provided by or through the School technology system will be error-free or without defect.  The School will not be responsible for any damage users may suffer, including but not limited to, loss of data, interruptions of service, or computer viruses.  The School is not responsible for the accuracy or quality of the information obtained through or stored on the School system.  The School will not be responsible for financial obligations arising through the authorized use of the system.

In accordance with the Children’s Internet Protection Act ("CIPA"), the School has placed a filter on its Internet access as one step to help protect its users from intentionally or unintentionally viewing inappropriate material.  The School blocks the categories that are determined to be potentially inappropriate.  However, families must be aware that some material accessible via the Internet contains illegal, defamatory, inaccurate, or potentially offensive language and/or images.  While the goal of the School is to use Internet resources to achieve educational goals, there is always a risk of students accessing other materials.  Parents should be aware of these risks.

## School Closings

In the event of inclement weather, CHCS will follow the Fulton County School District’s decision to close school.  If Fulton County Schools are closed due to weather, then CHCS is closed.

Should CHCS have the need to close due to circumstances other than weather, we will notify our families.

School closings for CHCS are announced on most channels.  CHCS will be listed as Chattahoochee Hills Charter School.  It is the responsibility of parents/guardians and students to access this information.  We will also update our Facebook page and website.

## Food Service

CHCS provides breakfast, lunch, and snack food service for its students.  The school participates in the National School Lunch Program, which provides free or reduced price breakfasts and lunches as well as free milk to eligible students.  Tables describing eligibility and applications to participate in the program will be provided at Open House.

Breakfast is served from 7:45 - 8:20 a.m. and is optional for all students.

Meals are pre-ordered online and pre-paid online or by cash or cashier’s check in the office.

Should your child request a meal at our school, then a meal will be given to your child, and you will be billed for the cost of that meal. Report cards may be held if meal fees are not paid.  If you would like to explicitly opt-out of the school’s meal program, and disallow your child from eating from CHCS Food Service, please provide the front desk with a written request.

## School Property

CHCS expects students to treat school property and equipment with care and responsibility.  School property includes the building and grounds, equipment including all technology, books and any other material possessions of CHCS.  Intentional actions to damage or harm school property may lead to a suspension or an expulsion hearing.   Should the damage be deemed as an unintentional act, students may be given the option of reimbursing the school and/or completing community service determined at the discretion of CHCS.

## Textbooks and Reading Backpacks

Students may be provided with school textbooks and library books.  students must maintain these books in good condition throughout the year.  Damaged or lost books will be the responsibility of the student and must be paid for based upon an amount assessed by the school.  Report cards may be held if book fees are not paid.

## Personal Property

All property brought to school is brought at the owner's risk.  CHCS does not assume responsibility for any property belonging to students.  Distracting or inappropriate objects will be taken from a student and a parent will be required to pick up the item from an administrator.  students should not bring large sums of money to school.

## Electronic Communication Devices

While on School property, in a School vehicle, or while attending School-sponsored or School-related activities, whether on or off School property, students shall be permitted to possess and use electronic communication devices, including, but not limited to, cellular phones, beepers, I-Pods, pagers, radios, CD/MP3/DVD players, video recorders, video games, personal data devices or other devices deemed to be distractive, provided they observe the following conditions:

1. Devices shall not be used in a manner that disrupts the educational process, or educational mission including, but not limited to, posing a threat to academic integrity or violating confidentiality or privacy rights of another individual.  Unless an emergency situation exists that involves imminent physical danger or a certified employee authorizes the student to do otherwise, devices shall be turned off during the School day.  They may be stored in the Student’s locker during the School day, but may only be turned on and operated before and after the regular school day.

2. When students violate this prohibition, they shall be subject to disciplinary action, including but not limited to losing the privilege of bringing the device onto School property.  In addition, an administrator may confiscate the device, which shall only be returned to the Student’s Parent.  All requests to confiscate these items must be complied with in a spirit of cooperation.  If, upon confiscation, the School becomes aware of other misuse of the device, or, has a reasonable suspicion of other violations of School policy, the Student may be disciplined for additional violations of this or other School policies.  In other words, a Student loses his/her privacy rights in the device and information contained in the device, once a School policy is violated and the device confiscated so long as the School has a reasonable suspicion of misuse.

3. students are responsible for devices they bring to School.  The School shall not be responsible for loss, theft, or destruction of devices brought onto School property.

4. students shall comply with any additional rules developed by the School concerning appropriate use of electronic communication devices.

5. students shall not utilize an electronic communication device in a manner that would violate the School’s Technology and Internet Acceptable Use Policy or its Student Code of Conduct.

6. Examples of types of prohibited behavior involving electronic communication devices include, but are not limited to:

    1. text messaging on or off School Property during School hours to or from a student on School Property;

    2. sexting, which is the act of sending sexually explicit messages or photographs, primarily between mobile phones or other electronic communication devices;

    3. using digital cameras or camera phones to invade the privacy of others by transmitting unauthorized or derogatory photos or video clips to another person via email, to another camera phone or by posting it on the web;

    4. using digital cameras, camera phones, or any other device to cheat on examination;

    5. playing digital games;

    6. using digital cameras, camera phones, or any other device to harass or bully another.

## Lost and Found

The school's lost and found is located at the front desk. Items not claimed within a month are donated to charitable organizations.

## School Supplies

It is the responsibility of students to come with appropriate materials to school.  Families will receive a school supply list no later than the end of July. If circumstances make this impossible, parents/guardians should speak with their child’s homeroom teacher.

## Student Records

CHCS maintains important information files on each student.  Parents and guardians have the right to inspect and review the student’s education records within forty-five (45) days of the receipt of a request for access to such records.  Such requests must be in writing and the school shall make arrangements for access to such records and shall notify the parent or eligible student of the time and place where such records may be inspected.  School officials may obtain access to your records for educational purposes only. All individually identifiable educational information is confidential except for "directory" information. Directory information includes the student’s name, date of birth, dates of attendance, degrees and other honors awarded.

## Release of Photographs and Other Information

CHCS will periodically create publications to highlight student achievement, school life and school events and will maintain a regular website with this information.  These publications and websites will be developed for the purposes of admissions, public relations, fundraising, and other uses that promote the school.  From time to time, the school may also get media requests to highlight the school and its students.

During the registration process, each parent/guardian will be provided with a Student Photo/Information Release form.  The school will honor these forms, such that student photographs will be included in publications only if the parent/guardian has granted permission.

## Distribution of Published Materials or Documents

Publications prepared by and for the school may be posted or distributed to the greater community, with prior approval by the Principal. Such items may include school posters, brochures, murals, etc. The school newspaper and the yearbook are available to students. All school publications are under the supervision of a teacher, sponsor, and the Leadership Team.

Unless a student obtains specific prior approval from an administrator, written materials, handbills, photographs, pictures, petitions, films, tapes, posters, or other visual or auditory materials may not be posted, sold, circulated, or distributed at school or on campus.  Materials displayed without this approval will be removed.

## Commerce

Students may not sell any articles on school property without the permission of the Principal.  They may not make a collection of money or materials for their own purposes or for an organization to which they belong outside of school without prior permission from the Principal.
