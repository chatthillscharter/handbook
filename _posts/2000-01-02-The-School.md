## Mission

Our mission is to inspire all children to the highest levels of academic achievement through a rigorous curriculum that integrates the wonders of the natural world.

The central focus of our educational program is a hands-on thematic instructional approach that uses the school’s unique rural surroundings as a framework.  It positions agricultural, environmental, and artistic themes as lenses through which the Georgia Performance Standards and Common Core Standards will be achieved and exceeded.

Our mission requires that we develop in all students the foundational skills, core content knowledge, critical-thinking ability, and personal characteristics necessary to succeed in life.  We can only accomplish this through a highly structured and engaging environment in which rigorous instruction drives every classroom and frequent assessments allow us to ensure every student is receiving the ongoing academic support necessary for success.

## What Makes Our School Different

CHCS is not a typical public school. We incorporate the arts, agriculture and the environment into everything that we do, and we use those things to keep your child engaged and inspired with their education.

At our school the classroom extends outside. We regularly teach on the trails that surround our school, and take walks to the neighboring Cochran Mill Nature Center. At our school, there are chickens, and those chickens may be part of a math class on any given day. There’s a planned farm, too, and planting seeds on that farm may help your child better understand Algebra. We believe in culture of possibility, where anything might be used -- from a hawk’s nest in a tree, to hummingbird zipping around our campus -- to inspire your child’s curiosity.

We want to be up front: our environmental curriculum takes a level of understanding from our families: This means little things like your child taking an interest in the bugs you might ordinarily swat in the house, to bigger things like your child coming home with muddy pants and dirt under their fingernails. While these may initially seem like inconveniences at home, we beg of you to be patient with it: they’re signs that your child is learning and inspired by the natural world around them.

Our educational philosophy and program are built on four core beliefs.

## Core Beliefs

In support of every student who enters our school doors, CHCS is passionately committed to four Core Beliefs:

1. All students have the ability to achieve academic excellence.

2. All students thrive in an engaging school environment.

3. All students deserve outstanding teachers that produce outstanding results.

4. All students deserve teamwork between parents and teachers.

### Core Belief 1: All students have the ability to achieve academic excellence.

It is our duty to provide the expectations, structures, and supports that will allow our students to efficiently and effectively strengthen any academic understanding and advance forward.

The expectations we provide: all students are college bound - everyone.  We expect students to behave well and work hard.  We expect students, families and staff to be accountable to each other for maintaining high expectations. All members of the school community will sign a contract of commitment, a pledge to do all in their power and whatever is necessary to achieve academic success.  We expect families to attend annual family orientations and participate in parent conferences throughout the year.  Progress Reports will be distributed one time each trimester and Report Cards will be issued at the end of each trimester.  We expect students to arrive at school on time, attend classes prepared to work and learn, and complete homework assignments thoughtfully, carefully, and on time.  We expect teachers to raise the bar by developing lessons that reflect passion for and knowledge of their subject, assign work that is challenging and engaging, and assess scholar progress thoughtfully, fairly, and regularly.

The structures we provide: all students participate in a structured school environment based upon respect and accountability for one’s actions, participate in an extended school year if needed, and complete challenging curricula.  

The supports we provide: upon entering CHCS, all students receive 90 minutes of integrated language arts and 90 minutes of integrated math instruction.

### Core Belief 2: All students thrive in an engaging school environment.

_"You have to build the culture first or you will never get to the academics."_ - Dr. Howard Fuller (NOTE:  Presentation by Dr. Howard Fuller at Building Excellent Schools on 11/18/06.)

A structured and engaging school environment will allow students to learn and teachers to teach.  It is our responsibility to implement a culture of respect and hard work every minute of every day.  School staff will explicitly teach values like graciousness, responsibility, organization, and innovation .  The school culture will make it "cool" to do well – and to help others.  CHCS will have clear, high expectations for scholar conduct and a discipline policy.  Through clear rules and constant positive reinforcement, all CHCS students will learn to take responsibility for themselves, their school, and their community.  Older students will be expected to provide leadership to their younger peers by modeling hard work and respectful behavior.

### Core Belief 3: All students deserve outstanding teachers that produce outstanding results.

*"The best teachers stand for a set of principles on which they will not compromise*."

- Rafe Esquith (NOTE:  Esquith, Rafe.  There are No Shortcuts.  New York: Anchor Books, 2004. 47.)

Teachers’ attitudes and actions critically influence scholar performance.  A teacher who moves too quickly through the curriculum, or who ignores the needs of a struggling scholar, shows favoritism to another, or complete apathy towards the subject material diminishes the possibility of success for many of his/her students.  Outstanding teachers have an uncompromising desire to see their students excel, challenge all of his/her students to do their best, learn the most, and see the world through new eyes.  Outstanding teachers have mastery in and passion for their content areas and instill such passion in their students, and they are prepared with strong lessons every day and with frequent assessments to ensure they have a clear understanding of what their students are learning.  **These are the teachers CHCS recruits**.

Experience with educating students in innovative environments and a track record of successful, measurable results in the classroom will be key characteristics our teachers possess.   A belief that every scholar can learn, and that standards-driven lessons and assessments are supportive of learning are also key.  The ideal candidate will be willing to work hard to give students discipline, boundaries, and challenges, and to work as a member of a mission-driven team relentless about academic results.  

CHCS will support its teachers in many ways.  New teachers will be trained in a four-week summer orientation prior to the start of the school year.  Professional development time will be part of the school’s weekly and annual schedule.  Meetings between the leadership team and teachers will be held regularly to exchange ideas, concerns, and supports.  Collaborative grade level teams will have regular opportunities to observe and learn from their colleagues.  Planning time will be incorporated into each teacher’s daily schedule.  All staff will have the professional supplies and resources necessary to challenge the students and themselves.

CHCS teachers will use materials demonstrating success with similar populations.  We will never use any one instructional approach in isolation, as we believe it is important to encourage teachers to devise the most comprehensive methods to deliver the best educational outcomes for students.  Curriculum will be standards-driven, and we will ensure that all students meet specific national, state, and school standards required before progressing into higher grades.  We believe that standards provide a clear and useful framework by which to measure real scholar progress and hold teachers accountable for student performance.

### Core Belief 4: All students deserve teamwork between parents and teachers.

We strive to set a tone of partnership between families and teachers. The most successful outcomes for students involve parent participation in the student’s education and well-being. Our teachers are expected to be in contact with you, to respond regularly to your requests for information, and to communicate progress with you. In return, families are expected to read notes sent home with the child, check, read, and reply to emails sent from the school, and actively support our teachers; mission to inspire your child with the natural world.

Our teachers default to electronic means of communications, primarily emails and text messaging with families. This allows the teacher a way to easily communicate with parents, attach documentation, and keep a record of their communication for the school. While phone calls may occur from time to time, please understand that electronic mail is the primary method of communication. All email addresses at CHCS follows the same pattern: firstname.lastname@chatthillscharter.org

Parent-teacher-child conferences are also critical to your child’s education. They will be scheduled with you during the school year, and your participation in them is a necessary part of being part of the team that is inspiring your child. We require 100% participation in parent-teacher conferences throughout the year.

There are also many means of participating with the school throughout the year. Because we are a charter school, we have a local board of trustees that are specific to our school. They have monthly meetings that are normally the first Monday of every month, at the school, at 7pm, with the exception of holidays, when they are held on the first Tuesday at 7pm. These meetings are open to the public, and have a public comment period, should you wish to address the board. You may also email the board at [board@chatthillscharter.org](mailto:board@chatthillscharter.org). The board maintains its own website with school policies and committee schedules at http://governance.chatthillscharter.org.
